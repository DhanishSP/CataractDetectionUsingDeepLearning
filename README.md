# CataractDetectionUsingDeepLearning
Description

A cataract is a cloudy area in lens which leads to deacrease in vision.So,this project uses deep learning convolutional neural network(CNN) to learn from a dataset which contains normal and cataract fundus images.
Prior to training the CNN model,the fundus images are precrossed and augmented using openCV library.
Then the CNN model is built and trained using the precrossed fundus images.

At end any  random fundus image can be feed into the model for prediction.
